## Introduction

The following tidy dataset was generated from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset," Version 1.0, which was created by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto (see License below).

According the readme document contained in the raw dataset, 30 volunteers between the ages of 19 and 48 performed six activities,  (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, researchers captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record, the following was generated in the original dataset:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The tidy dataset included in this repository extracts only the mean and standard deviation for each measured variable, averaged  for each activity and each subject.

An R script contatining the process of getitng and cleaning the data along with a codebook are also included in this respository.
